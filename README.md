# 0x0B. Unity - VR Room

Welcome to this VR Escape Room! In this game you are thrust into a futuristic space station and need to solve the (admittedly easy) puzzle in order to escape! Will you survive? 
Yes, the answer is yes. It really is pretty easy, but this is the first thing I've ever made in VR so it's actually kind of incredible (to me) too. Hope you enjoy!

This VR Escape Room is designed to be used with the Google-CardBoard and was created using Unity.
